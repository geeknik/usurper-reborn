# Usurper Reborn — Docker Deployment Guide

Host your own Usurper Reborn MUD server using Docker.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jknight/usurper-reborn.git
cd usurper-reborn

# Edit docker-compose.yml — change "YourAdminName" and "changeme"
docker compose up -d
```

**Game server**: port 4000 (raw TCP — BBS clients, MUD clients, SSH relay)
**Web interface**: port 80 (browser play, live stats, admin dashboards)

---

## Architecture

```
docker-compose.yml
├── usurper-game     Game server + world simulator (C#/.NET 8)
├── usurper-web      Web proxy + stats API + dashboards (Node.js)
├── usurper-nginx    Reverse proxy (nginx)
└── volume: usurper-data  Shared SQLite database (/var/usurper/)
```

All three containers share the `/var/usurper/` volume where the SQLite database lives. The game server writes game state; the web proxy reads it for stats and dashboards.

---

## Configuration

### docker-compose.yml

Key settings to customize before first run:

```yaml
services:
  usurper-game:
    command:
      - "--admin"
      - "YourAdminName"    # Replace with your username — grants God-level admin access
      - "--sim-interval"
      - "30"               # World sim tick rate in seconds (default: 30)
      # Optional additional flags:
      # - "--npc-xp"
      # - "0.25"           # NPC XP gain multiplier (default: 0.25)
      # - "--save-interval"
      # - "5"              # NPC state persistence interval in minutes (default: 5)

  usurper-web:
    environment:
      - BALANCE_USER=admin       # Dashboard login username
      - BALANCE_PASS=changeme    # Dashboard login password — CHANGE THIS
```

### Game Server Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--mud-server` | — | Start as MUD server (required) |
| `--mud-port <port>` | 4000 | TCP listen port |
| `--db <path>` | (next to exe) | SQLite database path |
| `--auto-provision` | off | Auto-create accounts for trusted auth connections |
| `--log-stdout` | off | Route logs to stdout instead of files |
| `--sim-interval <sec>` | 60 | World simulation tick interval |
| `--npc-xp <mult>` | 0.25 | NPC XP gain multiplier (0.01–10.0) |
| `--save-interval <min>` | 5 | How often NPC state is saved to database |
| `--admin <user>` | — | Bootstrap admin user (repeatable) |
| `--no-worldsim` | off | Disable embedded world simulator |

### Web Proxy Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MUD_MODE` | `1` | `1` = direct TCP to game server, `0` = legacy SSH relay |
| `MUD_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Game server hostname (use container name in Docker) |
| `MUD_PORT` | `4000` | Game server TCP port |
| `DB_PATH` | `/var/usurper/usurper_online.db` | SQLite database path |
| `BALANCE_USER` | `admin` | Dashboard login username |
| `BALANCE_PASS` | `changeme` | Dashboard login password |
| `BALANCE_SECRET` | (random) | JWT signing secret (auto-generated if not set) |

## Connecting

### Browser
Open `http://your-server` in a browser. Click "Play Now" for the embedded terminal.

### SSH (requires additional sshd setup)
The Docker setup doesn't include an SSH server. Players connect via the browser terminal or raw TCP. If you want SSH access, you can add an sshd container or configure your host's sshd with a ForceCommand that relays to the game server.

### BBS Passthrough
BBS software connects via raw TCP to port 4000 and sends an AUTH header:

```
AUTH:username:connectionType\n
```

With `--auto-provision` enabled (default in Docker), the game server automatically creates an account if the username doesn't exist. No separate registration needed.

**Example BBS integration** (Synchronet JavaScript):
```javascript
var sock = new Socket();
sock.connect("your-server", 4000);
sock.send("AUTH:" + user.alias + ":BBS\n");
// Relay I/O between BBS user and game socket
```

**AUTH header formats**:
```
AUTH:username:connectionType              Trusted auth (auto-provision if enabled)
AUTH:username:password:connectionType     Password auth
AUTH:username:password:REGISTER:type      Register new account with password
```

Connection types: `BBS`, `MUD`, `Web`, `SSH`, `Steam`, `Local`

### MUD Clients (Mudlet, TinTin++, etc.)
Connect via raw TCP to port 4000. The server will detect no AUTH header (500ms timeout) and present an interactive login menu.

---

## Dashboards

All dashboards are accessible via the web interface:

| URL | Description | Auth Required |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| `/` | Landing page with embedded terminal + live stats | No |
| `/dashboard` | NPC analytics (activities, relationships, timeline) | No |
| `/balance` | Combat balance analytics (win rates, damage stats) | Yes |
| `/admin` | Server admin panel (database, service status) | Yes |

Dashboard credentials are set via `BALANCE_USER` and `BALANCE_PASS` environment variables.

---

## Customization

### Custom Landing Page
Mount your own `index.html` to replace the default landing page:

```yaml
services:
  usurper-web:
    volumes:
      - usurper-data:/var/usurper
      - ./my-landing-page.html:/opt/usurper/web/index.html
```

The page should include xterm.js for the embedded terminal. See `docker/web/index.html` for the reference implementation.

### SSL/HTTPS
The nginx container listens on port 80 (HTTP). To add SSL:

1. Mount your certificates into the nginx container
2. Add an HTTPS server block to the nginx config

```yaml
services:
  usurper-nginx:
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./my-nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - ./certs:/etc/nginx/certs
```

Or use a reverse proxy like Traefik or Caddy in front of the stack for automatic Let's Encrypt.

### Multiple Admin Users

```yaml
command:
  - "--admin"
  - "Player1"
  - "--admin"
  - "Player2"
```

---

## Operations

### View Logs
```bash
docker compose logs -f usurper-game    # Game server logs
docker compose logs -f usurper-web     # Web proxy logs
docker compose logs -f usurper-nginx   # Nginx access logs
```

### Restart Services
```bash
docker compose restart usurper-game    # Restart game server only
docker compose restart                 # Restart all services
```

### Database Backup
```bash
# Copy database out of the volume
docker compose exec usurper-game cp /var/usurper/usurper_online.db /var/usurper/backup.db
docker compose cp usurper-game:/var/usurper/backup.db ./usurper-backup.db
```

### Update to Latest Version
```bash
git pull
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

### View Online Players
```bash
docker compose exec usurper-game sqlite3 /var/usurper/usurper_online.db \
  "SELECT username, display_name FROM players ORDER BY last_login DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

### Stop Everything
```bash
docker compose down           # Stop containers (keeps data)
docker compose down -v        # Stop containers AND delete database volume
```

## Troubleshooting

### Game server won't start
Check logs: `docker compose logs usurper-game`

Common issues:
- Database volume permissions — ensure the container can write to `/var/usurper/`
- Port 4000 already in use — change the host port mapping in docker-compose.yml

### Web proxy can't connect to game server
The web proxy connects to `usurper-game:4000` (Docker internal networking). If you changed the game server port, update `MUD_PORT` in the web service environment.

### Browser terminal won't connect
- Check that nginx is running: `docker compose logs usurper-nginx`
- Verify WebSocket upgrade is working: the nginx config proxies `/ws` to the web container
- If behind another reverse proxy, ensure it passes WebSocket upgrade headers

### Players can't connect via BBS
- Ensure port 4000 is exposed and reachable from the BBS server
- BBS must send `AUTH:username:BBS\n` as the first line within 500ms of connecting
- Check game server logs for auth failures: `docker compose logs usurper-game | grep AUTH`

### Database is locked
SQLite doesn't handle high concurrency well. If you see "database is locked" errors, the game server and web proxy may be contending. The web proxy opens the database in read-only mode by default, so this should be rare. Restart the web proxy if it persists.

## System Requirements

- Docker Engine 20.10+ and Docker Compose v2
- 512MB RAM minimum (game server uses ~256MB, web proxy ~64MB, nginx ~16MB)
- 1GB disk for the Docker images + database
- Linux host recommended (the game server binary is compiled for linux-x64)
