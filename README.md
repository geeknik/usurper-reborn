# Usurper Reborn

## A Persistent Online Text RPG with a Living World

**ALPHA v0.50.4** | **FREE AND OPEN SOURCE** | **GPL v2**

60+ autonomous NPCs wake up, go to work, visit taverns, fall in love, get married, have children, age, and eventually die of old age — all while you're offline. Log back in, read the news feed, and discover that the blacksmith married the barmaid, the king was assassinated, or a new generation just came of age. The world doesn't wait for you.

## The Living World

The core of Usurper Reborn is a 24/7 agent-based simulation. NPCs aren't quest dispensers standing in place — they're goal-driven agents with personalities, memories, and opinions about each other and about you.

**Autonomous NPCs** — Each NPC has 13 personality traits, a memory system (100 memories, 7-day decay), and a goal-based AI brain. They choose careers, form gangs, visit shops, train at the guild, and develop relationships with each other independently of player action.

**Full Lifecycles** — Married NPCs can become pregnant, have children, and raise them. Children grow up over real time and eventually join the realm as new adult NPCs. Adults age according to their race's lifespan (Human ~30 days, Elf ~80 days, Orc ~22 days) and die permanently when their time comes. The population turns over. No one is permanent.

**Emergent Events** — Marriages, divorces, affairs, births, coming-of-age ceremonies, natural deaths, gang wars, and political upheavals all happen organically and appear in the live news feed on the website and in-game.

**Persistent Multiplayer** — Connect via browser or SSH to a shared world backed by SQLite. Your actions affect other players. PvP arena, cross-player chat, leaderboards, and a news feed that captures everything happening in the realm.

## The Game

Beyond the simulation, there's a deep RPG with 100+ hours of content.

### Character Building

- **Ocean Philosophy** — A Buddhist-inspired awakening system with 7 levels: *"You are not a wave fighting the ocean. You ARE the ocean, dreaming of being a wave."*
